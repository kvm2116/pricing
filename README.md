# pricing
Pricing analysis for Virtual Machines (VM) and Serverless Computing (SC).

The goal:
- From user perspective, identify the virtualization platform (VM only, SC only, hybrid VM + SC) to minimize the costs given the prices set by the cloud provider for VM and SC
- From cloud provider perspective, identify the optimal pricing for VM and SC based on expected user workload distributions
